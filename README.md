# Ok look. Ignore this up here. I'am currently having a mental breakdown cause of Github and I belive that I'm going to fail cause I'm not doing Github. But now I will actually try to fix all the assinments I'm very late on doing and I will work more on Github to try to save my grade from being an F. I still need help getting pictures set up tho.

## The project:
The project is basaclly in simplier terms. Learning how to well manage Onshape. Such as making diffrent parts in 1 folder and then assembling them.
So the parts I'll be making is Base, mount, fork, tire, wheel, axle, collar, and bearings.
Then I will right all my work in this "journal" which is AKA Github. The first notebook was due Oct 2nd. But I'm a disapointment and is currently Oct 6th and I just completed the 1st one which is base. But If I submit the notebook before the end of this Friday I might have a chance to bounce back. So ya.

## Base  Turned in on Oct 6th but resubmitted on Oct 9th
The 1st part of this project is making the base. The base is well, the base and is probably where most of the parts will be assembled to.
This was due on Sep 25th. Its Oct 6th.I would add a picture but I still struggle with that. So no picture until I find out how. But the asignment it self was pretty easy. NGL when I first did it today I was like "I'm on the verg of failing for not doing easy Sh*t like this?" But I also just realized I can make italics with* so thats cool I guess. But the assignment is litarly draw a rectangle thats 200mm in width and 120mm in height. Then make it 8mm thick and just add six holes. 3 located on the top of the rectangle at the left, right, and middle part. The other 3 are on the same part but on the bottom side.

## Mount turned in on Oct 7th but resubmitted on Oct 9th
Mount is the second part of this porject on Onshape and I don't know what it's for. The assignment was easy. I just followed the video that was recorded and I made an 8 inch thick,120 mm I think square with 1 hole that is 25 mm in diameter that is located on the center point and 4 other smaller circles that are located on each end of the square.

## Fork turned in on Oct 8th but resubmitted on Oct 9th
The third part to this project is the fork. The fork is well a fork. I don't know what its for right now but eventually I will.

## Tire turned in on Oct 8th but resubmitted on Oct 9th
The 4th part of this project will be the tire. The tire is of course a tire. The tire in this assignment was made by a trapazoid with some dimentions and with a revolve instead of a extrudtion.

## Wheel turned in on Oct 8th but resubmitted on Oct 9th
The wheel is the 5th part of my late assignments that I just finished. The wheel goes inside the tire and is made in the tire as well In Onshape.

## Dowel Pins Turned in on Oct 7th but I didn't realize we had to make a frame as well so its like half way done.
Today on Oct 7th I submitted an assignment called Dorthy's Dowel Pins. On this assignment I followed instuctions from a video that was recorded by one of the Engineering teachers. A step by step guide on how to make the pins and a useful trick on Onshape. We learned how to make configurations for the pin and how to change it with a press of a button. We managed to change the height and length of the pin by just pressing a button. Also in my last class My teacher told us to make a frame. That's still a work in progres.

## Engineering Notebook for Oct 2nd but on Oct 9th
Its Oct 9th a week since Oct 2nd but just before the deadline for no return. So what did I learn? Well I learned that these Onshape assignments are ez clapz even though there late but thats because I have a bad habit on not turning things in on time and then I just give up. But now I'm trying to fix my Engineering class. The Notebook will be the things I will lookout for. I learned not to loose hope so early. I will try my best to turn things in on time in the future. I will try to turn in the Engineering journal for Oct 9th somewhere this coming week. That should include my progress with the Dowel pins and other assignments we do. Also I should have learned on how to put pictuers in my journal.

## Axle,Collar,Bearing Submitted on Oct 20th
Today I made the Bearing, Axle, and Collar for my Onshape project. These are the last things to make for Onshape currently and after this I will do the Onshape Fundamentals: Assemblies to fully complete my Onshape project and to move on to CircuitPython.

## Engineering notebook for Oct 16th but submitted Oct 21st
This week I finally added pictures to my notebook and I finished The Axle,collar, and Bearing on Onshape. I added them to my notebook with a link to all of them. I'm finally catching up to what were doing now. On Friday I will put the next Engineering Notebook on time. I hope. Also I will try to do the CircuitPython assigment and put it on my notebook. This week I learned how to put pictures on my notebook.

## Sub Assembly
This assignmnet is the first step to a full assembly. But we had to have a little test on the mateing. So we assembled our tire,wheel,bearings, and axles. This would be the bottem part of the full assembly which will be done shortly.

## Caster Assembly
The final thing I needed to do to fully finish my project and my experince with Onshape. Assembling all my parts and putting them together with mates. Putting together the base, wheel, bearings, nuts, bolts, and other parts to fully assemble it.
