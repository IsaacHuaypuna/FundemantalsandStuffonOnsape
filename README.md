# Ok look. Ignore this up here. I'am currently having a mental breakdown cause of Github and I belive that I'm going to fail cause I'm not doing Github. But now I will actually try to fix all the assinments I'm very late on doing and I will work more on Github to try to save my grade from being an F. I still need help getting pictures set up tho.

## The project:
The project is basaclly in simplier terms. Learning how to well manage Onshape. Such as making diffrent parts in 1 folder and then assembling them.
So the parts I'll be making is Base, mount, fork, tire, wheel, axle, collar, and bearings.
Then I will right all my work in this "journal" which is AKA Github. The first notebook was due Oct 2nd. But I'm a disapointment and is currently Oct 6th and I just completed the 1st one which is base. But If I submit the notebook before the end of this Friday I might have a chance to bounce back. So ya.

## Base
The 1st part of this project is making the base. The base is well, the base and is probably where most of the parts will be assembled to.
This was due on Sep 25th. Its Oct 6th.I would add a picture but I still struggle with that. So no picture until I find out how. But the asignment it self was pretty easy. NGL when I first did it today I was like "I'm on the verg of failing for not doing easy Sh*t like this?" But I also just realized I can make italics with* so thats cool I guess. But the assignment is litarly draw a rectangle thats 200mm in width and 120mm in height. Then make it 8mm thick and just add six holes. 3 located on the top of the rectangle at the left, right, and middle part. The other 3 are on the same part but on the bottom side.
